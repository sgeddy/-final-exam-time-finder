# NC State Final Exam Time Finder

WHY THIS TOOL WAS MADE:
This tool was made after a friend missed his final exam, because he wrote down the wrong day after a late night of studying. He believes if it was easier to get his final exam times, he wouldn't have made the mistake. This tool was made so you don't have to live through that the nightmare.         

HOW TO USE:
Input your class name (optional - your class will be referenced by the row number without one).

Select one of the common exams if you have one. (These  are exceptions to the schedule, so be sure to select one if you have  one).

Enter the day(s) and start time for your class.

Press Add Class and repeat steps 1-3 for all your classes.

Press Show Me My Final Exam Times, and your results will be shown below.

Be sure to add the results to your your calendar and good luck!
